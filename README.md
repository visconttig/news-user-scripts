# 🧘‍♂️ The Zen of Reading — Tampermonkey Scripts for Sanity and Flow™

### Because reading is sacred, attention is scarce, and “suggested content” is just digital junk mail dressed in HTML.

---

## 👋 What is this?

Welcome to **Reader Mode Nirvana**, a collection of Tampermonkey scripts forged in the fires of frustration by a multilingual news junkie who just wants to **read an article** without accidentally clicking on:

- 💸 a donation box that thinks it's a pop star,
- 🎧 an audio player that follows you like a clingy ex,
- 💬 a comment section that belongs in a philosophy debate,
- 👻 floating headers that occupy 47% of your viewport,
- 🔮 AI-generated “You may know this person who lives near your cousin’s dog” suggestions...

**These scripts surgically remove all that digital flotsam**—leaving behind clean, focused, learn-worthy content.

> Think of it as Marie Kondo meets DevTools. 🧹✨

## 📚 Why though?

Because I'm trying to actually *learn* something. I read a lot, in a lot of languages:

- 🇬🇧 English – advanced  
- 🇪🇸 Spanish – native/advanced  
- 🇵🇹 Portuguese – advanced  
- 🇨🇳 Chinese – simmering in the background  
- 🇮🇹 Italian – slowly marinating in spare time

And in all these languages, **there’s one universal enemy**: _UI chaos_.

## 🛠️ What Does Each Script Do?

### 📰 NPR — National Public Reader (Not Player)
Because NPR thinks you’re here for the pop-up audio player and not Pulitzer-grade journalism. This script **rips out the audio player**, the donation nags, and other well-meaning but flow-killing widgets. Bonus: colors that don’t burn your retina.

### 🧵 Reddit — From Chaos to Composure
Removes the sidebar, suggested content, and other things that have nothing to do with the thread you came for.  
Also, ensures your eyes don’t bleed from accidental exposure to endless scrolling suggestion traps. Minimalism achieved through **class-based hiding and loose selector coupling**. Modularity? Yes. Sanity? Absolutely.

### 🌎 BBC (Portuguese Edition) — Because Great Journalism Shouldn’t Come with “Suggested TikToks”
Cleans up “Most Read,” “Top Stories,” podcast promos, and those super subtle (*not*) sticky footers. Uses a well-organized `selectorMap` for scalable hiding, and even intercepts annoying inline clickbait links like a bodyguard intercepting bad vibes.

### 🗞️ ElDiario.es — Español Zen Edition
Focus on the news, not the circus. Say goodbye to author avatars, random embedded tweets, suggested videos, tag overload, and yes — the classic “you might like this other article that is 17% related because it contains the word ‘democracy.’”  
Also smashes the Piano paywall modal with elegant finality. 🧼

### 💼 LinkedIn — Corporate Calm Mode
Because nothing says “productive scrolling” like being told to follow someone you met once in 2014. This script uses **custom logic to keep regionally relevant suggestions** (e.g., “Santiago Metropolitan Area”), but politely yeets the rest into oblivion.  
Also neutralizes the LinkedIn newsfeed like a digital Muay Thai master. 🥋

## 💡 What’s Actually Cool Here?

- ✅ **Modular selectors**: Built using flexible `selectorMap`s so future tweaks are just a key away.
- 🧠 **Smart filters**: Text-based logic avoids overzealous nuking (i.e., we don’t throw out the baby with the RSS feed).
- 🔄 **MutationObserver magic**: Handles dynamically injected content without blinking. Like a monk who learned JavaScript.
- 🌍 **Multilingual-ready UX**: Keeps UI friction-free, because high-vocab comprehension in multiple languages deserves better than being interrupted by a floating newsletter signup modal.

## 🙃 Is This Overkill?

Absolutely.  
But so is putting a donation banner on a footer on top of a sticky header over a half-visible article while autoplaying a podcast and recommending I follow someone from high school because we both once searched for "remote jobs."

## 💌 Dear Recruiter...

If you're here out of curiosity, hello! 👋  
Yes, I write code that removes the distractions *most designers work hard to insert*. I value clarity, flow, and getting to the **core experience** — whether it’s through UI cleanup, readable logic, or simply respecting the reader’s cognitive load.

Also, yes — I do read serious journalism in three (and a half-ish) languages. So if you want someone who can:

- Think clearly,
- Write clean code,
- And debug JavaScript **and** Mandarin mistakes with equal levels of calm...

Feel free to reach out. 😉

## 🌊 In Pursuit of Flow

Because the Internet doesn’t need more features.  
It needs **less #!@X!!** between you and what actually matters.

Peace.  
Scripts.  
And deep reading.
